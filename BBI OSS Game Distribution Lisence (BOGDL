BBI OSS Game Distribution License (BOGDL)

Version 1.5

Preamble:

This License is designed to promote the openness and collaborative development of games. It grants certain rights to modify and distribute games covered under this license, subject to the conditions set forth herein.

Definitions:

- Person A: Refers to the original creator of the game covered under this license.
- Person B: Refers to any individual who modifies and redistributes the game originally created by Person A.
- Person C: Refers to any individual who redistributes the game modified by Person B.
- Profit: Total income generated by the modified game, minus the amount invested in the modification of the game.

License Terms:

1. Open Source Requirement: Any game covered under this license must be made available as open source. The complete source code, including any modifications, must be freely accessible to the public.

2. Modification and Redistribution by Person B: Person B is permitted to modify and redistribute the game created by Person A. However, Person B must give 10% of the profit generated by the modified game to Person A. Profit is defined as the total income from the modified game minus the amount invested in the modification.

3. Profit Sharing in Chain: If Person C redistributes the game modified by Person B, Person C must give 10% of the profit generated by the redistributed game to Person B. Additionally, 10% of the remaining profit (after giving 10% to Person B) must be given to Person A.

4. Attribution Requirement: If Person B copies code from Person A, Person B must clearly mention in the README.md file that the original game is forked, reused, or copied from Person A. Similarly, if Person C redistributes the game modified by Person B, the chain of contributors (e.g., Person A > Person B) must be documented in the README.md file.

5. Prohibition of Proprietary Modification: Any modification made to the game covered under this license cannot result in the game becoming proprietary. It must remain open source.

6. In-App Purchase Regulation: If the game includes in-app purchases added by Person A, and Person B makes modifications unrelated to in-app purchases, the money transfer details for the existing in-app purchases must remain unchanged. Any purchases made for existing in-app items must still be directed to Person A's bank account. If Person B adds new in-app purchases, only the profit generated from the new items will be attributed to Person B.

Disclaimer:

This license is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The authors or copyright holders shall not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from this license.

Conclusion:

This License is intended to foster collaboration and ensure fair distribution of profits among contributors to open source games. By using or modifying a game covered under this license, you agree to abide by its terms and conditions.
