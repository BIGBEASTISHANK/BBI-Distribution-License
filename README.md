# BBI FOSS Distribution License (BBIFDL)

Version 1.7, March 2024

> [!Note]
> This license helps people keep the code public and also prevents great loss by creating FOSS projects.

## Explaining Terms and Conditions

1. **Distribution and Modification**: Any modifications made to the code covered by this license for distribution purposes must be made available to the public for free of cost. This means that if you improve or customize the software, you need to share those modifications with others. 

    - *Example*: If you enhance an open-source text editor by adding new features like syntax highlighting or improved search functionality, you must make those modifications publicly available to others who use the text editor.

2. **Private Use**: Users are allowed to modify the code for their own use and keep it private. However, if the modified code interacts with the original code, those modifications must be made public. 

    - *Example 1*: You modify a web browser to improve its performance, but keep it solely for personal use. Since the modified browser doesn't interact with the original code, you're not required to share your modifications.
    
    - *Example 2*: You create a plugin for a popular video editing software that adds new effects. Since this plugin interacts directly with the original software, you must share it with others who use the software.

3. **Distributed Copy Permission**: Before distributing any modified versions of the code, you must obtain permission from the original code owner. This ensures proper credit and adherence to the licensing terms.

    - *Example 1*: You modify an open-source music player to include a feature for streaming music from online services. Before sharing your modified version, you need to obtain permission from the original developers.
    
    - *Example 2*: You customize a blogging platform to add advanced SEO features. Before distributing your customized version to others, you must seek permission from the creators of the original platform.

4. **Profit Sharing**: If you distribute a modified version of the code and generate profit from it, the original code owner is entitled to 1% of the total profit generated by that code. This includes profits from donations, sponsors, or any other source.

    - *Example 1*: You modify an open-source video game and sell it on an app store. If you earn $1000 in total revenue from the game, the original game creator is entitled to $10 (1% of $1000) in profit sharing.
    
    - *Example 2*: You customize a customer relationship management (CRM) software and offer it as a service to businesses, charging a subscription fee. If you earn $5000 in total revenue from the service, the original software creators are entitled to $50 (1% of $5000) in profit sharing.

5. **Calculation of Profit**: The profit to be shared is calculated as the total revenue generated from the distributed code minus the cost incurred to make the modifications. This ensures that the profit sharing is fair and based on the actual value added by the modifications.

    - *Example*: You modify an open-source e-commerce platform to include additional payment gateways and custom themes. If it cost you $200 to make these modifications and you earn $1000 from selling the customized platform to clients, the original code owner is entitled to $8 (1% of $800, which is $1000 - $200) in profit sharing.

6. **Uniform License**: All copies of the original code must be distributed under the same BBI Distribution License. This maintains consistency in licensing terms and encourages collaboration among developers.

7. **Non-Proprietary Usage**: The code covered by BBIFDL cannot be used in any proprietary manner. This ensures that the software remains open and accessible to all users.

8. **Profit Sharing Chain**: If a modified version of the code is further redistributed, the profit sharing obligation extends to the immediate previous distributor. Each subsequent distributor is responsible for sharing 1% of the profit with the distributor from whom they obtained the code. The profit sharing chain does not extend to the original code owner beyond the first distribution. Therefore, any profit generated from subsequent distributions is shared only with the distributor from whom the code was directly obtained.
